A github action which deploys and destroys Ephemeral Github Runner.

1. [PREREQUISITES](#prerequisites)
2. [EXPLANATION](#inputs)
3. [AWS](#aws-configuration)
4. [GCP](#gcp-configuration)

## Prerequisites

Before starting make sure:

1. You have a [github app](https://github.com/pavlovic-ivan/ephemeral-github-runner/blob/main/QUICKSTART.md#github-app-setup) linked to the repository where the runners have to work (Same repo of the one inside config.yaml file).
2. You have an account set up in either AWS or GCP.
3. You have a ready backend on the cloud provider you want to use (<s3://bucket_name> or <gs://bucket_name>).
4. You have a machine image on the cloud provider you want to use.

## Inputs

Everything below is required. There are no default values provided.

- pulumi-config-path: A path to your Pulumi project config file
- pulumi-goal: The name of the Pulumi goal. Supported values: create, destroy
- pulumi-stack-name: The name of the Pulumi stack.
- pulumi-cloud-provider: The name of the Pulumi cloud provider. Supported providers: aws, gcp
- cloud-architecture: Supported architecture names: amd64 or arm64 (no support for gcp + arm64)

## Environment Variables

- APP_ID: GitHub App ID
- APP_PRIVATE_KEY: GitHub App Private Key
- PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE: A passphrase that will be used to encrypt secrets

AWS:

- PULUMI_BACKEND_URL: Path to the S3 bucket in format -> s3://bucket_name
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Your access key id received when account was created
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Your secret access key received when account was created
- AWS_REGION: AWS region, eg. eu-west-2

GCP:

- PULUMI_BACKEND_URL: Path to the GS bucket in format -> gs://bucket_name
- GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS:  GCP credentials
- GOOGLE_PROJECT: GCP project ID
- GOOGLE_REGION: GCP region e.g. 'europe-west4'
- GOOGLE_ZONE: GCP zone e.g. 'europe-west4-a'

## AWS Configuration

Create a file called config.yaml with following content:

```yaml
config:
  ephemeral-github-runner:bootDiskSizeInGB: "100"
  ephemeral-github-runner:bootDiskType: gp2
  ephemeral-github-runner:labels: <comma-separated list of runner labels>
  ephemeral-github-runner:machineImage: <path to the AWS AMI machine image with Github runner installed>
  ephemeral-github-runner:machineType: <machine type of your choice>
  ephemeral-github-runner:owner: <GitHub org or username under which the repo is>
  ephemeral-github-runner:repo: <GitHub repo name>
  ephemeral-github-runner:runnersCount: "1"
  
 ```

 It isn't mandatory to put the  config file in the root directory. Example: 'dir1/dir2/config.yaml.'

## Usage example with AWS

```yaml
name: ephemeral-runners
on: <Event on which the action have to start>
jobs:
    manage-runners:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: LorenzoDrudi/ephemeral-github-runner-action@<version to use>
            env:
              PULUMI_BACKEND_URL: ${{ secrets.PULUMI_BACKEND_URL }}
              APP_ID: ${{ secrets.APP_ID }}
              APP_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
              PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE: ${{ secrets.PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE }}
              AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
              AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
              AWS_REGION: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}
            with:
              pulumi-config-path: <Path to the config file. e.g. dir1/dir2/config.yaml>
              pulumi-goal:  <Pulumi goal. Supported: create, destroy>
              pulumi-stack-name: <Stack name>
              pulumi-cloud-provider: 'aws'
              cloud-architecture:  <Architecture to use. Supported: amd64, arm64>
              pulumi-backend-url: ${{ secrets.PULUMI_BACKEND_URL }}
```

All the personal inputs are passed by github secret.

  ephemeral-github-runner:machineImage: <path to the GCP machine image with Github runner installed>
  ephemeral-github-runner:machineType: <machine type of your choice>
  ephemeral-github-runner:owner: <GitHub org or username under which the repo is>
  ephemeral-github-runner:repo: <GitHub repo name>
  ephemeral-github-runner:runnersCount: "1"
```

              pulumi-stack-name: <Stack name>
              pulumi-cloud-provider: 'gcp'
              cloud-architecture:  'amd64' #It's the only arch supported with gcp cloud provider.
              pulumi-backend-url: ${{ secrets.PULUMI_BACKEND_URL }}
```

## How to Contribute

The repo use [@vercel/ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) to compile the project inside a single file, look to [dist folder](./dist).\
Every time you make changes to the source files you have to execute this command:

```sh
npm run prepare
```

Then commit and push also the changes in the dist folder.

## Main projects

Main project: [ephemeral-github-runner](https://github.com/pavlovic-ivan/ephemeral-github-runner)

Images builder: [ephemeral-github-runner-image](https://github.com/pavlovic-ivan/ephemeral-github-runner-image)

## Important

The workflow will fail if the cloud architecture == arm64 and the pulumi cloud provider == GCP.
